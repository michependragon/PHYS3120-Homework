# PHYS 3120 -- Computational Physics // Homework 1
Name: Michelle Ukiwe

### exercise one

#### a. Do you have a github account? 
I do have a [github account](https://github.com/michependragon)

#### b. What programming languages do you know? If you know multiple ones, which one are you most comfortable with?
I know python and c++. I'm most comfortable with __python__

#### c.
I've held a very strong interest in computational research (chemistry, physics, etc.) and I've always wanted to understand the methods the researchers I admire use. In addition to this, to be able to apply them to research projects I may encounter in the future. _This class is required for the Applied Physics BS_ but, I was very excited to take it for this reason, and I hope to become a better programmer. 


### exercise 4
With git version control you may track changes made to files over time. Allowing you to refer back to versions of code from months or years ago. I definitely plan to use this to track the stages of some data science projects. In the past, I'd  save the file repeatedly and name them different things, but this is much more streamlined and efficient.
